BARON RAFF, COUNT PETOUCHOF.

        <p>
            
<h6 class = "name princepetro">PRINCE PETRO.</h6>
<p class ="speech"> So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
at last, and is to take his seat here again.</p>
<h6 class ="name princepaul">PRINCE PAUL.</h6>
<p class = "speech">Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.</p> 
<h6 class = "name princepetro">PRINCE PETRO.</h6>
<p class = "speech"> Naturally; you are always speaking.</p>
<h6 class ="name princepaul">PRINCE PAUL.</h6>
<p class = "speech"> No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.</p><br>
<h6 class = "name countr">COUNT R.</h6> 
<p class = "speech">Still, anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.</p>
<h6 class ="name princepaul">PRINCE PAUL.</h6>
<p class = "speech"> My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place.
<p class = "stage-direction"> (_Enter the
CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._)</p> Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
Highness is looking a little pale to-day.</p>
<h6 class = "name czare">CZARE.</h6>
<p class = "stage-direction"> (_slowly, after a pause_).</p><p class = "speech"> I want change of air.</p>
<h6 class ="name princepaul">PRINCE PAUL</h6>
<p class = "stage-direction"> (_smiling_). </p><p class = "speech">A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial
father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in
Russia.</p>
<h6 class = "name czare">CZARE.</h6>
<p class = "stage-direction"> (_bitterly_).</p> <p class = "speech">My Imperial father had kept me for six months in
this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see
some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery,
though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.</p>
<h6 class ="name princepaul">PRINCE PAUL.</h6>
<p class = "speech"> When you are as old as I am, Prince, you will understand
that there are few things easier than to live badly and to die well.</p>
<h6 class = "name czare">CZARE.</h6>
<p class = "speech"> Easy to die well! A lesson experience cannot have taught you,
whatever you may know of a bad life.</p>
<h6 class ="name princepaul">PRINCE PAUL</h6>
<p class = "stage-direction">(_shrugging his shoulders_).</p>
 <p class = "speech">Experience, the name men give
to their mistakes. I never commit any.</p>
<h6 class = "name czare">CZARE.</h6>
 <p class = "stage-direction">(_bitterly_).</p>
 <p class = "speech"> No; crimes are more in your line.</p>
<h6 class = "name princepetro">PRINCE PETRO.</h6>
<p class = "stage-direction"> (_to the CZAREVITCH_).</p>
<p class = "speech"> The Emperor was a good deal
agitated about your late appearance at the ball last night, Prince.</p>
[1]<h6 class = "name countr">COUNT R.</h6>
 <p class = "stage-direction">(_laughing_).</p>
 <p class = "speech"> I believe he thought the Nihilists had broken
into the palace and carried you off.</p>
<h6 class = "name baronraff">BARON RAFF.</h6>
<p class = "speech"> If they had you would have missed a charming dance.[1]</p>
<h6 class ="name princepaul">PRINCE PAUL.</h6> 
<p class = "speech">And[2] an excellent supper. Gringoire really excelled
himself in his salad. Ah! you may laugh, Baron; but to make a good salad
is a much more difficult thing than cooking accounts. To make a good
salad is to be a brilliant diplomatist--the problem is so entirely the
same in both cases. To know exactly how much oil one must put with one's
vinegar.</p>
<h6 class = "name baronraff">BARON RAFF.</h6>
<p class = "speech"> A cook and a diplomatist! an excellent parallel. If I had a
son who was a fool I'd make him one or the other.</p>
<h6 class ="name princepaul">PRINCE PAUL.</h6>
<p class = "speech">I see your father did not hold the same opinion, Baron.
But, believe me, you are wrong to run down cookery. For myself, the only
immortality I desire is to invent a new sauce. I have never had time
enough to think seriously about it, but I feel it is in me, I feel it is
in me.</p> 
<h6 class = "name czare">CZARE.</h6>
<p class = "speech"> You have certainly missed your _metier_,[3] Prince Paul; the
_cordon bleu_ would have suited you much better than the Grand Cross of
Honour. But you know you could never have worn your white apron well;
you would have soiled it too soon, your hands are not clean enough.</p>
<h6 class ="name princepaul">PRINCE PAUL</h6>
<p class = "stage-direction">(_bowing_).</p>
<p class = "speech"> Que voulez vous? I manage your father's
business.</p>
