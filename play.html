        </h4>
        <p>
            
<h6>PETRO.</h6><p> So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
at last, and is to take his seat here again.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6><p>Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.</p> <br>

<h6>PRINCE PETRO.</h6><p> Naturally; you are always speaking.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6><p> No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.</p><br>

<h6>COUNT R.</h6> <p>Still, anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6><p> My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place.<p> (_Enter the
CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._)</p> Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
Highness is looking a little pale to-day.</p><br>

<h6>CZARE.</h6><p> (_slowly, after a pause_).</p><p> I want change of air.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL</h6><p> (_smiling_). </p><p>A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial
father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in
Russia.</p><br>

<h6>CZARE.</h6><p> (_bitterly_).</p> <p>My Imperial father had kept me for six months in
this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see
some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery,
though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6><p> When you are as old as I am, Prince, you will understand
that there are few things easier than to live badly and to die well.</p><br>

<h6>CZARE.</h6><p> Easy to die well! A lesson experience cannot have taught you,
whatever you may know of a bad life.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL</h6> <p>(_shrugging his shoulders_).</p> <p>Experience, the name men give
to their mistakes. I never commit any.</p><br>

<h6>CZARE.</h6> <p>(_bitterly_).</p><p> No; crimes are more in your line.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PETRO.</h6><p> (_to the CZAREVITCH_).</p><p> The Emperor was a good deal
agitated about your late appearance at the ball last night, Prince.</p><br>

[1]<h6>COUNT R.</h6> <p>(_laughing_).</p><p> I believe he thought the Nihilists had broken
into the palace and carried you off.</p><br>

<h6>BARON RAFF.</h6><p> If they had you would have missed a charming dance.[1]</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6> <p>And[2] an excellent supper. Gringoire really excelled
himself in his salad. Ah! you may laugh, Baron; but to make a good salad
is a much more difficult thing than cooking accounts. To make a good
salad is to be a brilliant diplomatist--the problem is so entirely the
same in both cases. To know exactly how much oil one must put with one's
vinegar.</p><br>

<h6>BARON RAFF.</h6><p> A cook and a diplomatist! an excellent parallel. If I had a
son who was a fool I'd make him one or the other.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6><p>I see your father did not hold the same opinion, Baron.
But, believe me, you are wrong to run down cookery. For myself, the only
immortality I desire is to invent a new sauce. I have never had time
enough to think seriously about it, but I feel it is in me, I feel it is
in me.</p> <br>

<h6>CZARE.</h6><p> You have certainly missed your _metier_,[3] Prince Paul; the
_cordon bleu_ would have suited you much better than the Grand Cross of
Honour. But you know you could never have worn your white apron well;
you would have soiled it too soon, your hands are not clean enough.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL</h6><p>(_bowing_).</p><p> Que voulez vous? I manage your father's
business.</p><br>

<h6>CZARE.</h6> <p>(_bitterly_).</p> <p>You mismanage my father's business, you mean! Evil
genius of his life that you are! before you came there was some love
left in him. It is you who have embittered his nature, poured into his
ear the poison of treacherous counsel, made him hated by the whole
people, made him what he is--a tyrant!</p><br>

<p>(_The courtiers look significantly at each other._)</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL </h6><p>(_calmly_).</p><p>I see your Highness does want change of air. But
I have been an eldest son myself. (_Lights a cigarette._) I know what it
is when a father won't die to please one.</p> <br>

<p>(_The CZAREVITCH goes to the top of the stage, and leans against the
window, looking out._)</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PETRO.</h6> <p>(_to BARON RAFF_).</p><p> Foolish boy! [4]He will be sent into
exile, or worse, if he is not careful.[4]</p><br>

<h6>BARON RAFF.</h6><p> Yes.[5] What a mistake it is to be sincere!</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PETRO.</h6><p> The only folly you have never committed, Baron.</p><br>

<h6>BARON RAFF.</h6><p> One has only one head, you know, Prince.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6><p> My dear Baron, your head is the last thing any one would
wish to take from you.</p> <p>(_Pulls out snuffbox and offers it to PRINCE
PETROVITCH._)</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PETRO.</h6> <p>Thanks, Prince! Thanks!</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6><p> Very delicate, isn't it? I get it direct from Paris. But
under this vulgar Republic everything has degenerated over there.
"Cotelettes à l'impériale" vanished, of course, with the Bourbon, and
omelettes went out with the Orleanists. La belle France is entirely
ruined, Prince, through bad morals and worse cookery. (_Enter the
MARQUIS DE POIVRARD._) Ah! Marquis. I trust Madame la Marquise is well.</p><br>

<h6>MARQUIS DE P.</h6><p> You ought to know better than I do, Prince Paul; you see
more _of_ her.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL</h6> <p>(_bowing_).</p><p> Perhaps I see more _in_ her, Marquis. Your wife
is really a charming woman, so full of _esprit_, and so satirical too;
she talks continually of you when we are together.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PETRO.</h6> <p>(_looking at the clock_).</p> <p>His Majesty is a little late
to-day, is he not?</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6> <p>What has happened to you, my dear Petrovitch? you seem
quite out of sorts. You haven't quarrelled with your cook, I hope? What
a tragedy that would be for you; you would lose all your friends.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PETRO.</h6><p> I fear I wouldn't be so fortunate as that. You forget I
would still have my purse.[6] But you are wrong for once; my chef and I
are on excellent[7] terms.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6><p>Then your creditors or Mademoiselle Vera Sabouroff have
been writing to you? I find both of them such excellent correspondents.
But really you needn't be alarmed. I find the most violent proclamations
from the Executive Committee, as they call it, left all over my house. I
never read them; they are so badly spelt as a rule.</p> <br>

<h6>PRINCE PETRO.</h6><p> Wrong again, Prince; the Nihilists leave me alone for some
reason or other.</p><br>
