        </h4>
        <p>
            
<h6>PRINCE PETRO.</h6><p> So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
at last, and is to take his seat here again.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6><p>Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.</p> <br>

<h6>PRINCE PETRO.</h6><p> Naturally; you are always speaking.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6><p> No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.</p><br>

<h6>COUNT R.</h6> <p>Still, anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6><p> My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place.<p> (_Enter the
CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._)</p> Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
Highness is looking a little pale to-day.</p><br>

<h6>CZARE.</h6><p> (_slowly, after a pause_).</p><p> I want change of air.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL</h6><p> (_smiling_). </p><p>A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial
father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in
Russia.</p><br>

<h6>CZARE.</h6><p> (_bitterly_).</p> <p>My Imperial father had kept me for six months in
this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see
some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery,
though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6><p> When you are as old as I am, Prince, you will understand
that there are few things easier than to live badly and to die well.</p><br>

<h6>CZARE.</h6><p> Easy to die well! A lesson experience cannot have taught you,
whatever you may know of a bad life.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL</h6> <p>(_shrugging his shoulders_).</p> <p>Experience, the name men give
to their mistakes. I never commit any.</p><br>

<h6>CZARE.</h6> <p>(_bitterly_).</p><p> No; crimes are more in your line.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PETRO.</h6><p> (_to the CZAREVITCH_).</p><p> The Emperor was a good deal
agitated about your late appearance at the ball last night, Prince.</p><br>

[1]<h6>COUNT R.</h6> <p>(_laughing_).</p><p> I believe he thought the Nihilists had broken
into the palace and carried you off.</p><br>

<h6>BARON RAFF.</h6><p> If they had you would have missed a charming dance.[1]</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6> <p>And[2] an excellent supper. Gringoire really excelled
himself in his salad. Ah! you may laugh, Baron; but to make a good salad
is a much more difficult thing than cooking accounts. To make a good
salad is to be a brilliant diplomatist--the problem is so entirely the
same in both cases. To know exactly how much oil one must put with one's
vinegar.</p><br>

<h6>BARON RAFF.</h6><p> A cook and a diplomatist! an excellent parallel. If I had a
son who was a fool I'd make him one or the other.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL.</h6><p>I see your father did not hold the same opinion, Baron.
But, believe me, you are wrong to run down cookery. For myself, the only
immortality I desire is to invent a new sauce. I have never had time
enough to think seriously about it, but I feel it is in me, I feel it is
in me.</p> <br>

<h6>CZARE.</h6><p> You have certainly missed your _metier_,[3] Prince Paul; the
_cordon bleu_ would have suited you much better than the Grand Cross of
Honour. But you know you could never have worn your white apron well;
you would have soiled it too soon, your hands are not clean enough.</p><br>

<h6>PRINCE PAUL</h6><p>(_bowing_).</p><p> Que voulez vous? I manage your father's
business.</p><br>
